It is because despite being extremely simple, some important concepts of Games are covered.
Specially the famous Game Loop, that stay infinitely processing user input (keyboard, mouse, joistick), apply changes on model elements of game (due to user input), and finally render elements on screen.

This simple game uses SDL library [https://www.libsdl.org/] for render on screen the game.
